# Mnist-Digit-Classification-Keras

In this project i use keras and tensorflow to classify digits and python's tkinter library to visualize 
for using the models, I recommend you use networkV1.h5 because it's slightly more accurate.
If you want to learn more about digital drawing and visualization
you can check out my "
Microsoft-Paint-Clone-with-Python" repository.

-How to use the app?
For using the app you can draw digits while pressing the left click on your mouse
if you want to save the number you can click on the "save as png" button 
and if you want model to predict you can press "predict" 
whenever you want to delete or clear the screen you can always press on the "clear screen" button
